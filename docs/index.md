# Project Daedalus – Assistive Technology for Accessible CNC Education

**SENAI + FRC 9461 MecaChronos**  
Making CNC programming accessible through tactile Braille pieces and a magnetic board.

## 🎯 Overview
Project Daedalus transforms CNC and programming education into a **tactile and inclusive experience**.  
It allows students who are blind or visually impaired to build CNC programs using **Braille blocks** arranged on a **magnetic board**, simulating the structure of real G-code and logic.

## 🧩 Quick Start
1. Go to [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)  
2. Download and print the 3D pieces from the [`/stl`](../stl/) folder  
3. Assemble the **magnetic base and Braille blocks** (see the [Mechanical Assembly](section-06_mechanical-assembly.md))  
4. Use the examples in [`/examples`](../examples/) for your first lesson  

## 🔗 Useful Links
- [Onshape (CAD source)](links.md#onshape)
- [Tinkercad (simplified models)](links.md#tinkercad)
- [Google Drive (manuals and PDFs)](links.md#google-drive)

## 🧠 Objectives
- Make CNC and programming education **inclusive** for blind and low-vision students  
- Provide a **modular educational kit** with Braille-based blocks and open documentation  
- Support teachers with ready-to-use **lesson plans, CAD files, and STL models**
