# Project Daedalus – Assistive Technology for Accessible CNC Education

**SENAI + FRC 9461 MecaChronos**

Inclusive CNC programming through tactile Braille pieces and a magnetic board.

[🇧🇷 Read in Portuguese](../pt/index.md)

---

## 🎯 Overview
Project Daedalus transforms CNC and programming education into a **tactile and inclusive experience**.  
It allows students who are blind or visually impaired to build CNC programs using **Braille blocks** arranged on a **magnetic board**, simulating the structure of real G-code and logic.

## 🧩 Quick Start
1. Visit the [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)  
2. Download and print the 3D pieces from the [`/stl`](../../stl/) folder  
3. Assemble the **magnetic board and Braille blocks** (see [Mechanical Assembly](section-06_mechanical-assembly.md))  
4. Try the examples in [`/examples`](../../examples/) for your first lesson

## 🧠 Objectives
- Make CNC/programming education **inclusive** for blind and low-vision students  
- Provide a **modular educational kit** with Braille-based blocks and open documentation  
- Support teachers with ready-to-use **lesson plans, CAD files, and STL models**
